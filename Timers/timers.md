🚀 **Day 10 of My 30-Day Embedded Systems Challenge**

Today, I built a simple yet classic project — **LED Blinking using the 8051 microcontroller (AT89C51)**. This experiment demonstrates how to control digital outputs and generate software-based delays to make LEDs blink at a visible rate.

🧠 **How It Works:**

* The LEDs are connected to **Port 2** of the AT89C51.
* A simple **nested loop delay** function is used to create a time gap between ON and OFF states.
* The program continuously toggles all LEDs, creating a visible blinking pattern.

⚙️ **Tools Used:**

* **Keil uVision** for coding and HEX file generation
* **Proteus** for circuit design and simulation
* **12 MHz crystal** with reset and power circuitry for proper operation

💡 **Concepts Learned:**

* Basics of digital I/O on 8051
* Software delay generation
* Understanding timing loops and simulation timing
