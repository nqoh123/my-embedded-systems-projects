# LCD Display Controlled by Switch ‚Äì Embedded Systems Project

üìÖ **Day 7 of My 30-Day Embedded Systems Challenge**

This project demonstrates how a **16x2 LCD** can display different messages based on a **push-button switch input** using an **8051 microcontroller (AT89C51)**. When the switch is pressed, the LCD updates to show a new message; when released, it returns to the default message.

---

## **Project Overview**

- **Microcontroller:** AT89C51 (8051 family)
- **Language:** Embedded C
- **IDE:** Keil ¬µVision
- **Simulation:** Proteus 8 Professional
- **Hardware Components:**  
  - 16x2 LCD  
  - Push Button Switch  
  - Resistors & Capacitors  
  - Crystal Oscillator

## **How It Works**

1. The LCD is connected in **8-bit mode** with the microcontroller.
2. A **push-button switch** is connected to pin **P2.5** (or any configurable digital input pin).
3. The program continuously checks the state of the switch:
   - **Default:** Switch not pressed ‚Üí LCD displays `Nqobile`.
   - **Pressed:** LCD updates to show two lines of text:
     ```
     Aditya University, Surampalem
     East Godavari, AP
     ```
   - **Released:** LCD returns to the default message.
4. The logic is implemented in **Embedded C** and simulated in **Proteus**.
